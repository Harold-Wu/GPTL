# GPTL: Genomic Prediction Using Transfer Learning

### This package contains several methods for Genomic Prediction Using Transfer Learning, including
 -  A Gradient Descent Algorithm with Early Stopping
 -  A Penalized regression with srhinkage towards a prior mean (e.g., estimates derived from another data set)
 -  Examples using Pooled Sufficient Statistics   
 -  A Bayesian model that allows Transfer Learning through prior means.
