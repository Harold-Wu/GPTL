# GPTL: Genomic Prediction Using Transfer Learning

### This package contains several methods for Genomic Prediction Using Transfer Learning, including
 - 1) A Gradient Descent Algorithm with Early Stopping
 - 2) A Penalized regression with srhinkage towards a prior mean (e.g., estimates derived from another data set)
 - 3) Examples using Pooled Sufficient Statistics   
 - 4) A Bayesian model that allows Transfer Learning through prior means.
